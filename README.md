# bump

my own dumb version bump

# usage

```
bump patch 1.0.1  # -> 1.0.2
bump minor 1.0.1  # -> 1.1.0
bump major 1.0.1  # -> 2.0.0
```

# get it

i needed this tool to work on several os/platforms 

just grab the binary from the releases page and integrate it in your ci/cd
pipeline

# motivation

I tried 7 (SEVEN) bump version tools and none of them did what I wanted.

* take version via argument
* print out increased version
* be a simple binary.

Thats all. It sounds stupid but this does the job.
